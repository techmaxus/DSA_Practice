Example : Covid Queue
Any queue with certain priority like age in above Example

Can be solved u7sing sorting in NlogN time

PQ will help to solve in N+klogN time

3 Operations :
    1 Insertion : O(logN)
    2 Pop Max / Pop Min : O(logN)
    3 Get Min / Get Max : O(1)

Min heap : used to extract max element
Min heap : used to extract min element

What is a Heap?
1. Binary Tree : at max 2 elements
2. Complete Binary tree (CBT) : All except last level must 
    be fully filled and left to right insertion in last level
3. Heap order property : In case of max heap parent 
    must be greater than both children

We visualise the heap as a binary tree so that relationship 
between parent and children can be properly visualised

But Since it is a Complete Binary Tree It can be 
easily Flattened into an Array
for any node its children are at 2i and 2i+1
Parents are present at i/2

Insertion in heap
place the new element after last index in the array 
and compare it with its parent unit either it is the 
top most element or the heap property is satisfied

Priority queue STL
push() , pop() , top() function are built in
By Default a max heap is created which can be changed by passing additional arguments

Brute Force : Sorting ==> NlogN + klogN
Min Heap : build + pop k element ==> N + klogN

better
build a max heap of size k
